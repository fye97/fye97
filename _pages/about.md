I’m an Post-Doctor Fellow at the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/) (UVic), with Prof. [Lin Cai](https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~cai/). I received my Ph.D. degree in the Southeast University (SEU), Nanjing, China, in June 2024. During 2022–2023, I was a research assistant at the University of Victoria, Canada. My current research areas include cyber-physical systems, networked/distributed control systems, with a special focus on the security and privacy issues. I’m a Member of IEEE.
